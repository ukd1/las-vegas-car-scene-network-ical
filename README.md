# Car Scene Network iCal Feed

I couldn't find an iCal feed of events for local Las Vegas car events, so I made one. It updates daily. This one is for the [Car Scene Network](https://tickets.thefoat.com/lasvegascarmeets/host_id-110971/)

You should be able to subscribe to: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ukd1/las-vegas-car-scene-network-ical/main/las-vegas-car-scene-network-events.ics` in most calendar suites.
